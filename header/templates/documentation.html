            Welcome to the documentation for the pyStat application. This web application aims to provide a low-code solution for conducting various statistical tests.
            Its primary functionality revolves around the dataset you upload, which is converted into a dataframe upon upload. 
            You can upload your dataset using a CSV file by clicking the 'Upload CSV' button at the top of the page.
            Once you've uploaded your CSV file, the names of the columns containing numerical values will be displayed on the homepage.
            To proceed with using this app, select the button corresponding to the desired statistical test. 
            This action will generate a widget on the canvas (homepage) that you can interact with by dragging columns to the designated area.
            After clicking the calculate button, the widget will process and display the results of the corresponding test on the page.
            For detailed explanations of the theory, background, and exact functionality of each widget, refer to the information provided on this page.

        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-start" >
        Statistics is a mathematical field that aims to analyze and make inferences from data. 
        It is primarily concerned with understanding how data is structured and assessing the uncertainty within that data. 
        A crucial aspect of statistics involves drawing samples from a larger population, such as all customers, to make informed conclusions.
        For these conclusions to be valid, it is essential that the sample is representative of the entire population. 
        This is why a random sample is often preferred, as it helps prevent sample bias.
        Data can be divided into two main categories, each of which can be further subdivided into several types  (Neal & Cavey, 2022):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><p class="text-start"><b>Numerical Data</b></p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Discrete: Numerical values that take a finite set of possibilities (e.g., How many siblings do you have?).</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Continuous: Numerical values that can take any value within a continuous range (e.g., height).</p></li>
                </ul>
            <li ><p class="text-start"><b>Categorical Data</b></p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Ordinal: Categorical values that have a natural order (e.g., education level).</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Nominal: Categorical values that do not have a natural order (e.g., eye color).</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Binary: Data with only two possible outcomes (e.g., pass/fail, yes/no).</p></li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2> Summary Statistics</h2>
        <p class="text-start" >
        Any numerical value calculated from data is called a statistic. Therefore, statistics are functions of data. 
        Before calculating complex statistical functions from your data, it is important to gain some general information about your data. 
        This information is obtained by calculating simple summary statistics, which can be divided into two types: measures of location and measures of spread  (Neal & Cavey, 2022).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">Measures of location aim to calculate a value that is typical for the data, such as the mean, mode, and median.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Measures of spread aim to explain how variable your data is. Included in this category are metrics like the variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-start" > 
            It is possible to create a summary Statistic widget by pressing the corresponding button.
            When you drag a column to the designated area, the summary Statistic widget will calculate the following statistics:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">Mean: The average of all values.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Median: The middle value when all values are ordered from smallest to largest.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Variance: A measure of the spread of the values in the dataset, indicating how far each value is from the mean.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, providing a measure of the spread of the values around the mean in the same units as the data.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Count: The total number of values in the dataset column.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Min: The smallest value.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Max: The largest value.</p> </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-start" >
            These simple summary statistics provide a quick overview and deeper insight into the characteristics of your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
        <p class="text-start">
            Hypothesis testing aims to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.
            In other words, it is a form of statistical inference. A standard hypothesis test typically follows these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">Formulate the null hypothesis (H0), which represents your assumption about the data.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Formulate the alternative hypothesis (H1), which is the hypothesis you want to test.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Calculate the p-value based on your statistical test.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Compare the p-value to your chosen level of significance, often denoted as &alpha;.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Accept or reject your hypotheses based on the comparison.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-start">
            The p-value indicates the likelihood of observing the sample values. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected. 
            For example, in a test for normality, the p-value indicates how likely the results are if the data were normally distributed. 
            A low p-value in this case suggests that the data is not normally distributed. A P-value of 0.05 can be read as a 5% change that this data would come from a normal distribution.
            Which is why, with a low p-value we can be almost sure that are hypotheses is not correct. 
            The significance level, typically set at 0.05, is chosen to minimize type 2 errors (false negatives), since we do not want to reject the null hypotheses while it is true. (Anderson, D. R., Sweeny, D. J., & Williams, n.d.).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Normality Test</h2>
        <p class="text-start">

            The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most important distributions in statistics. 
            It is used in many statistical tests as an assumption because real-world data often fits the normal distribution. 
            Essentially, the normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetrical around the mean, meaning that data around the mean are more likely to occur than data far from the mean. 
            The standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (Chen, J., 2024).
        </p>

        <p class="text-start">  
            Since the normal distribution is often assumed, it is important to determine if your data follows a normal distribution. 
            This is the purpose of the normality test widget. By dragging a column to this widget, it will perform a normality test on the data. 
            The normality test follows the normal hypothesis testing workflow, which is as follows:"
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">H0: The sample comes from a normal distribution.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">H1: The sample does not come from a normal distribution.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Statistical test: \( s^2 + k^2 \) (where \( s \) is the z-score returned by skewtest and \( k \) is the z-score returned by kurtosistest). More information can be found on <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.normaltest.html#id2">SciPy</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>T Test</h2>
        <p class="text-start" >
        The ttest aims to test if the means of two indepdenent samples are significantly different from each other. 
        It makes the assumption that the data is approximly normally distributed.
        The t-test widget can be used to execute a test on two columns which are dragged to it.
        It follows the normal hypothesis testing workflow, which is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">H0: The sample have identical averages</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">H1: The sample do not have identical averages</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">The t-statistic. More information can be found on <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.normaltest.html#id2">SciPy</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Correlation</h2>
        <p class="text-start">
            Correlation is defined as a measure that quantifies the strength of the relationship between two variables. 
            The correlation coefficient, ranging between -1 and 1, indicates both the strength and direction of this relationship. 
            The correlation widget enables users to compute the correlation between two columns. 
            Upon creating the correlation widget and selecting a column, it calculates the correlation coefficient using the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
            Furthermore, it conducts a hypothesis test to ascertain the significance of the correlation and assess whether the data follows a normal distribution. (Turney, S. 2024)
            If there is a low p-value, the null hypothesis can be rejected, indicating that the correlation is significant.
