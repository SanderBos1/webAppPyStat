        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p class="text-start" >
        Welcome to the documentation for the pyStat application. This web application aims to provide a low-code solution for performing various statistical tests.
        Its core functionality revolves around your uploaded dataset, which is converted into a dataframe upon upload.
        Numerical columns from your CSV dataset are then displayed on the homepage.
        You can drag these columns to your chosen widget, created using the buttons on the left side of the homepage.
        Each widget calculates a specific statistical function on the selected dataset column.
        The theory and exact functionality of each widget are explained on this page.
        </p>


        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-start" >
        Statistics is a mathematical field that aims to analyze and make inferences from data. 
        It is primarily concerned with understanding how data is structured and assessing the uncertainty within that data. 
        A crucial aspect of statistics involves drawing samples from a larger population, such as all customers, to make informed conclusions.
        For these conclusions to be valid, it is essential that the sample is representative of the entire population. 
        This is why a random sample is often preferred, as it helps prevent sample bias.
        Data can be divided into two main categories, each of which can be further subdivided into several types  (Neal & Cavey, 2022):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><p class="text-start"><b>Numerical Data</b></p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Discrete: Numerical values that take a finite set of possibilities (e.g., How many siblings do you have?).</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Continuous: Numerical values that can take any value within a continuous range (e.g., height).</p></li>
                </ul>
            <li ><p class="text-start"><b>Categorical Data</b></p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Ordinal: Categorical values that have a natural order (e.g., education level).</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Nominal: Categorical values that do not have a natural order (e.g., eye color).</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-start">Binary: Data with only two possible outcomes (e.g., pass/fail, yes/no).</p></li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2> Summary Statistics</h2>
        <p class="text-start" >
        Any numerical value calculated from data is called a statistic. Therefore, statistics are functions of data. 
        Before calculating complex statistical functions from your data, it is important to gain some general information about your data. 
        This information is obtained by calculating simple summary statistics, which can be divided into two types: measures of location and measures of spread  (Neal & Cavey, 2022).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">Measures of location aim to calculate a value that is typical for the data, such as the mean, mode, and median.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Measures of spread aim to explain how variable your data is. Included in this category are metrics like the variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-start" > 
            In this web application, you can create a "Summary Statistic Widget." 
            The purpose of this widget is to calculate various summary statistics for a selected column of your uploaded dataset. 
            The widget calculates the following metrics:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">Mean: The average of all values.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Median: The middle value when all values are ordered from smallest to largest.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Variance: A measure of the spread of the values in the dataset, indicating how far each value is from the mean.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, providing a measure of the spread of the values around the mean in the same units as the data.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Count: The total number of values in the dataset column.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Min: The smallest value.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Max: The largest value.</p> </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-start" >
            These simple summary statistics provide a quick overview and deeper insight into the characteristics of your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
        <p class="text-start">
            Hypothesis testing aims to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.
             In other words, it is a form of statistical inference. A standard hypothesis test typically follows these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">Formulate the null hypothesis (H0), which represents your assumption about the data.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Formulate the alternative hypothesis (H1), which is the hypothesis you want to test.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Calculate the p-value based on your statistical test.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Compare the p-value to your chosen level of significance, often denoted as &alpha;.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Accept or reject your hypotheses based on the comparison.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-start">
            The p-value indicates the likelihood of observing the sample values. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected. 
            For example, in a test for normality, the p-value indicates how likely the results are if the data were normally distributed. 
            A low p-value in this case suggests that the data is not normally distributed. 
            The significance level, typically set at 0.05, is chosen to minimize type 2 errors (false negatives) (Anderson, D. R., Sweeny, D. J., & Williams, n.d.).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Normality Test</h2>
        <p class="text-start">
            The normality test aims to determine if a dataset is normally distributed by using the normal hypothesis testing workflow, which is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">H0: The sample comes from a normal distribution.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">H1: The sample does not come from a normal distribution.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">Statistical test: \( s^2 + k^2 \) (where \( s \) is the z-score returned by skewtest and \( k \) is the z-score returned by kurtosistest). More information can be found on <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.normaltest.html#id2">SciPy</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>T Test</h2>
        <p class="text-start" >
        The ttest aims to test if the means of two indepdenent samples are significantly different from each other. It follows the normal hypothesis testing workflow, which is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="text-start">H0: The sample have identical averages</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">H1: The sample do not have identical averages</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-start">The t-statistic. More information can be found on <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.normaltest.html#id2">SciPy</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
